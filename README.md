## Three personas, one dashboard

The page is laid out top-to-bottom so each persona finds their answer where they look first.

**CEO / Founder · top of page · 5 seconds to grasp**
- Executive Header with yesterday's MER as a big number against Phase 1/2/3 goal band
- Margin Protection rules — any rule tripped surfaces in red at the top
- Executive Summary table with all 23 KPIs (filter Gold only)

**Manager · middle of page · 30 seconds to scan**
- Conversion Funnel diagnostic (Impressions → Click → ATC → IC → Purchase with drop-off %)
- Funnel Stage Allocation (Prospecting / Retargeting / Reactivation actual vs target %)
- **9 Campaign Cards** — *new in v5.3* — each card now shows all 6 Gold KPIs per campaign with phase-specific targets:
  - MER · NC-ROAS · AOV · Contribution Margin · CAC Payback · Repeat Rate
  - CAC Payback and Repeat Rate honestly marked "account-level only · needs Shopify"
  - Tap any card to drill into operator view
- Interactive Trends chart with metric + scope filters
- Audience Segments (F35-44 goldmine, M18-34 exclusion check)

**Operator · click any campaign · everything needed to act**
- **Campaign Diagnostic Banner** — "why target not achieved" with prioritized actions
- **Goal Performance section** — *new in v5.3* — full table for the 6 Gold KPIs (Goal · Where We Are · Gap to Goal · Status · What This Means) plus CAC as supporting metric
- **Operational Detail section** — Spend pace, Revenue pace, Orders pace, CTR, Link CTR, CVR, CPC, Frequency, IC → Purchase
- Daily trend chart with metric selector
- Ad-set table with diagnostic recommendations ("KILL · ₹24.7k for 1 order · 0.18x = losing 82% on every ₹1")
- Ad-level table with per-ad action (KILL / PAUSE / REFRESH / AUDIT / WATCH / SCALE / HOLD / EARLY)

## What this dashboard shows

**Top-line (the management showcase view):**
- **Executive Header** — yesterday's MER as a big number with traffic-light status against Phase 1/2/3 goal band, plus a one-line summary ("6 of 10 gold KPIs on target · 2 at risk · 2 below target")
- **Margin Protection Rules** — all 10 rules from Section 14, with TRIPPED / HOLDING status and evidence. Surfaces at the top because these are the rules that prevent contribution-negative scaling.
- **Executive Summary table** — Goal · Where We Are · Status · What This Means · What To Do for all 23 KPIs (16 from Section J + 7 conversion funnel KPIs). Filter to Gold (the 6 CEO metrics) or Silver (tactical).
- **Conversion Funnel panel** *(v5.1)* — Impressions → Link Clicks → ATC → Init Checkout → Purchase. Each stage shows count, conversion rate from previous, drop-off %, and benchmark target. Highlights the biggest leak (e.g., "IC → Purchase losing 64.2% — Razorpay/GoKwik checkout health · was 48.8% baseline, 36% today").
- **Funnel Stage Allocation** — Prospecting / Retargeting / Reactivation actual vs target % per phase
- **9-Campaign Matrix** — one card per campaign with phase-specific Goal / Actual / Gap / Kill rule status + CVR + CTR + AOV + Frequency at a glance. Click any card for ad-level detail.
- **Campaign Detail** (modal) — full TAPG table for 10 campaign KPIs · kill-rule alert banner · interactive chart with values labeled · ad-set table with recommendation · **ad-level table with per-ad action** *(v5.1)* applying Sheet 16 Section 3 thresholds: each ad gets KILL / PAUSE / REFRESH / AUDIT / SCALE / HOLD / BUILDING verdict with reasoning. Direct links to Meta Ads Manager for any ad.
- **Interactive Trends** — chart with metric filter (ROAS, Spend, Revenue, CPA, AOV, Orders) and scope filter (Account total, by stage, or any of 9 campaigns). Target and kill lines drawn.
- **Audience Segments** — F35-44, F25-34, etc. with Goal ROAS vs actual. Surfaces "Exclusion Broken" alert if any spend leaks to Male 18-34 (which should be excluded permanently).
- **Pre-Flight Checklist** — 22-item launch readiness tracker with localStorage persistence.
- **Auto-refresh** *(v5.1)* — toggle Off / 5min / 15min / 30min in the header. Live "synced X seconds ago" counter.

**Conversion metrics added in v5.1:**
- **CVR · Click → Purchase** — the conversion engine (≥1.5% P1 · ≥2.0% P2 · ≥2.5% P3)
- **Link CTR** — link clicks / impressions (≥1.0-1.5% by phase)
- **ATC Rate** — Add-to-Cart per link click (≥4-6% by phase)
- **IC → Purchase %** — Razorpay/GoKwik checkout health (≥40-50% by phase · baseline 36%, target 48.8%+)
- **Hook Rate (3-sec)** — creative quality signal (≥25-30% by phase)
- **CPC** — Cost per link click (≤₹30-40 by phase)
- **CTR** — total CTR including image clicks (≥1.0-1.5% by phase)

**Per-ad action engine (v5.1 + v5.2 context-aware):**
Every ad gets a verdict based on its own data **AND** the parent ad set + parent campaign performance. This prevents the dishonest "Building signal" verdict when a child ad is part of a failing concept.

- **Cold prospecting (PDF rules):** ROAS <1.0x at ₹15K → KILL within 24hr · 1.0-1.4x → REFRESH hook (unless parent failing, then KILL) · ≥1.5x → PROMOTE +20%
- **Day-7 early kill:** <0.7x at ₹5K spend → EARLY KILL (Sheet 16 rule, before ₹15K gate)
- **Catastrophic kill:** <0.5x at ₹3K spend → EARLY KILL (no recovery path)
- **Parent-context KILL** *(v5.2)*: If the parent ad set has spent ₹15K+ at <0.6x ROAS, ANY child ad with 0 orders at ₹2K+ gets killed — no more "Building signal" on doomed concepts. Same rule at ad-set <1.0x for child ads at ₹3K+.
- **Warm RT (C8):** <1.5x at ₹8K → KILL within 48hr · ≥2.5x → PROMOTE
- **Hot DPA (C7):** <2.0x at ₹5K → CATALOG AUDIT (not creative) · ≥3.5x → SCALE +25%
- **Reactivation (C9):** <2.5x at ₹5K → REFRESH hook + window · ≥5.0x → SCALE +30%
- **Universal:** Frequency >3.5x → PAUSE · >3.0x → REFRESH · 0 orders at ₹5K → KILL · CVR <0.3% on 800+ clicks → KILL (creative or LP broken)

**Campaign Diagnostic Banner (v5.2):**
At the top of every Campaign Detail modal, when severity is CRITICAL or WARNING, a banner answers "*why is the target not being achieved?*" with specific issues identified from the data:

- **ROAS gap** with exact deficit vs phase target band
- **AOV gap** — flags when realized AOV is below 70% of bundle target. For Core Pair: "AOV ₹4,443 = 57% of target ₹7,800 · means buyers picking SINGLE SKUs, not the bundle. Either creative isn't selling bundle value, OR /collections/core-pair PDP isn't enforcing bundle pricing at checkout."
- **Failing ad sets** — names + ROAS + spend for any ad set <1.0x at ₹8K+ spend
- **Ad-level kill count** — how many ads are flagged KILL or PAUSE
- **Trend deterioration** — flags 3-day declining ROAS or zero-revenue latest day

Then a **prioritized action list** specific to the failure mode: pause failing ad sets first, audit bundle PDP if AOV issue, brief NEW bundle creatives, halt new ad-set additions, set 7-day decision point.

**Honest verdict levels (v5.2):**
- **KILL / PAUSE** (red) — stop spend immediately, no recovery path
- **REFRESH / AUDIT** (amber) — creative or feed issue, 7-day window
- **WATCH** (amber) — concerning early signal, kill at threshold if no change
- **SCALE** (green) — winner, +20-30% budget
- **HOLD** (gray) — within performance band, monitor
- **EARLY** (gray) — below spend gate, too early to judge honestly
- **IDLE** (very gray) — no spend yet

**Status language used throughout:**
- ON TARGET · AT RISK · BELOW TARGET · NOT YET TRACKED
- Plain English: "Meeting the goal" · "Close to goal · watch" · "Below goal · action needed" · "Not enough data yet"
- Every KPI has: *What This Means* (the metric in plain English) + *What To Do* (the action if breached)

## The 6 Gold KPIs per campaign (v5.3 honest treatment)

The user requested all 6 Section J Gold KPIs at the per-campaign level. Here's what's possible per-campaign vs account-level only:

| KPI | Per-campaign? | How / Why |
|---|---|---|
| **MER** (Campaign ROAS) | ✓ Yes | Campaign revenue / spend |
| **NC-ROAS** | ✓ For prospecting only | Audience already excludes past purchasers 90d, so for prospecting NC-ROAS ≈ ROAS. For RT/Reactivation marked N/A. |
| **AOV** | ✓ Yes | Campaign revenue / orders |
| **Contribution Margin** | ✓ Yes | Revenue × 55% GM − Ad spend − Orders × ₹120 shipping |
| **CAC Payback** | ✗ Account-level only | Requires LTV model · needs Shopify cohort + repeat-purchase data per customer |
| **Repeat Purchase Rate** | ✗ Account-level only | Requires Shopify customer database for cohort attribution |
| **CAC** (supporting) | ✓ Yes | Spend / orders — included as a 7th supporting metric since it's the operational lever |

The two that aren't possible per-campaign are shown on every card with `—` and a clear "account-level only" note, so nobody mistakes a data gap for a tracking gap. The account-level Gold KPIs are still tracked in the top Executive Summary table.

## How to update targets when phases change

When you move from Phase 1 to Phase 2 (Day 31), no edit needed — the app auto-detects the phase from `phaseStartIST` in `config.js` and shows Phase 2 targets automatically.

To change phase start date (e.g., delayed launch):

```js
// config.js
phaseStartIST: '2026-05-15T00:00:00+05:30',   // change this date
```

To change any campaign's predicted ROAS or budget:

```js
// config.js · find the C1 entry
{ slot: 'C1', ...,
  dailyBudget:  { p1: 14000, p2: 14000, p3: 15000 },   // ← edit these
  predictedRoas:{ p1: [1.4, 1.6], p2: [1.5, 1.7], p3: [1.6, 1.9] },   // ← or these
  ...
}
```

To change a Section J KPI band:

```js
// config.js · find kpis.mer (or whichever KPI)
mer: {
  ...
  bands: { p1: [1.6, 1.9], p2: [2.2, 2.7], p3: [2.8, 3.5] },   // ← edit these
  ...
}
```

Push to GitHub → refresh browser → new targets live.

## What's wired vs what's pending

✅ **Live from Meta** (working now):
- MER, ROAS by campaign, CPA, AOV, Spend, Orders, CTR, CPC, IC→Purchase, Frequency, Hook rate
- Audience segment breakdown (age × gender)
- Contribution margin (computed from revenue × 55% GM minus spend minus ₹120/order shipping)
- All ad-set and ad-level detail

⏳ **Renders as "—" with "Needs Shopify wire" tag** (until those integrations are added):
- Repeat Rate 60d (needs Shopify customer cohort)
- Prepaid Mix % (needs Shopify payment attribute)
- Cancel Rate % (needs Shopify order status)
- Discount % of Subtotal (needs Shopify discount applied)
- Bundle Attach Rate (needs Shopify line-item attribute)
- Refund Rate (needs Shopify refunds endpoint)
- Email Klaviyo Rev/wk (needs Klaviyo API)
- WhatsApp Rev/wk (needs BiteSpeed API)
- Click → Session % (needs GA4 connection)
- NC-ROAS (needs Shopify customer-cohort split)

These render with their **correct targets** so management sees what's being tracked vs what needs wiring. Once you add Shopify/Klaviyo/BiteSpeed connectors (v6 scope), they'll start populating live.

## Brutal-honest closing notes

This dashboard **reports correctly** against the locked plan. It does **not fix** the structural problems documented in the source PDFs:

1. **Click → Session 76% leak** — that's a Shopify theme problem (likely Mojito Lab JS). The dashboard will surface it; only a tech audit fixes it.
2. **₹1,000 flat off cannibalization** — the legacy code needs to sunset on Day 30 per the plan. Dashboard tracks discount %; manually killing the code is on the founder.
3. **Margin Rule R2 (ROAS floor)** will trip on Day 7-14 if exclusions aren't applied — verify Male 18-34 + 18 wasted cities + 5 high-cancel states are excluded at the **account level** before launch (checklist items #11, #15).
4. **NC-ROAS masking (R9)** — without Shopify cohort wiring, this rule is "Pending data". Until then, blended MER alone can hide a degrading new-customer acquisition. The plan documents this; the dashboard can't compute it without the connector.

Phase 1 success = MER 1.6-1.9x by Day 30 with contribution margin between -₹2L and +₹3L. The plan is sequenced as STABILIZE → BUILD → SCALE for a reason: do not scale spend until Phase 1 targets are met.
